In this project, we predict the severity of a road accident based on the circumstances in which it occurred. We are operating within a supervised learning framework, where we will utilize classification methods such as decision trees and random forests. We have used data from the 2020 accident reports available on Données Québec. (accident-reports-2020.csv)
